# The Staff Engineer's Path

## Introduction

**Big-picture thinking**

Big-picture thinking means being able to step back and take a broader view. It means seeing beyond the immediate details and understanding the context that you're working in. It also means thinking beyond the current time, whether that means initiating yearlong projects, building software that will be easy to decommission, or predicting what your company will need in three years.

**Execution**

At the staff level, the projects you take on will become messier and more ambiguous. They'll involve more people and need more political capital, influence, or culture change to succeed.

**Leveling up**

Every increase in seniority comes with more responsibility for raising the standards and skills of the engineers within your orbit, whether that's your local team, colleagues in your organization, or engineers across your whole company or industry. This responsibility will include intentional influence through teaching and mentoring, as well as the accidental influence that comes from being a role model.

You're going to need "humaning” skills, like:

-   Communication and leadership
-   Navigating complexity
-   Putting your work in perspective
-   Mentorship, sponsorship, and delegation
-   Framing a problem so that other people care about it
-   Acting like a leader whether you feel like one or not

## Part I. The Big Picture

### Chapter 1. What Would You Say You Do Here?

Three reasons titles are necessary: "Helping people understand that they are progressing, vesting authority in those people who might not automatically receive it, and communicating an expected competency level to the outside world.”

Good decisions need context. Experienced engineers know that the answer to most technology choices is "it depends.” Knowing the pros and cons of a particular technology isn't enough—you need to know the local details too. What are you trying to do? How much time, money, and patience do you have? What's your risk tolerance? What does the business need? That's the context of the decision.

To avoid local maxima, teams need decision makers (or at least decision influencers) who can take an outsider view—who can consider the goals of multiple teams at once and choose a path that's best for the whole organization or the whole business.

Just as important as seeing the big picture of the situation now is being able to anticipate how your decisions will play out in future. A year from now, what will you regret? In three years, what will you wish you'd started doing now?

TPMs are responsible for delivery, not design, and not engineering quality. TPMs make sure the project gets done on time, but staff engineers make sure it's done with high engineering standards.

Staff engineers are role models. Managers may be responsible for setting culture on their teams, enforcing good behavior, and ensuring standards are met. But engineering norms are set by the behavior of the most respected engineers on the project. No matter what the standards say, if the most senior engineers don't write tests, you'll never convince everyone else to do it. These norms go beyond technical influence: they're cultural, too. When senior people vocally celebrate other people's work, treat each other with respect, and ask clarifying questions, it's easier for everyone else to do that too.

Like it or not, humans pay attention to status and hierarchies—and reporting chains. You're likely to have much less influence if you're reporting to a line manager. The information you get is also prone to be more filtered and centered on the problems of that specific team. If your manager doesn't have access to some piece of information, you almost certainly won't either.

Be prepared to ignore your scope when there's a crisis: there is no such thing as "not my job” during an outage, for example.

If your scope is too broad (or undefined), there are a few possible failure modes:

-   **Lack of impact**. If anything can be your problem, then it's easy for everything to become your problem, particularly if you're in an organization with fewer senior people than it needs. There will always be another side quest: in fact, it's all too easy to create a role that's entirely side quests, with no real goal at all.9 Beware of spreading yourself too thin. You can end up without a narrative to your work that makes you (and whoever hired you) feel like you achieved something.
-   **Becoming a bottleneck**. When there's a senior person who is seen to do everything, the convention can become that they need to be in the room for every decision. Rather than speeding up your organization, you end up slowing them down because they can't manage without you.
-   **Decision fatigue**. If you escape the trap of trying to do everything, you'll have the constant cost of deciding which things to do. I'll talk in Chapter 4 about choosing your work.
-   **Missing relationships**. If you're working with a very broad set of teams, it's harder to have enough regular contact to build the sorts of friendly relationships that make it easier to get things done (and that make work enjoyable!). Other engineers also lose out: they don't get the sort of mentorship and support that comes from having a "local” staff engineer involved in their work.

But watch out for the risks of a scope that's too narrow:

-   **Lack of impact.** It's possible to spend all of your time on something that doesn't need the expertise and focus of a staff engineer. If you choose to go really deep on a single team or technology, it should be a core component, a mission-critical team, or something else that's very important to the company.
-   **Opportunity cost.** Staff engineers' skills are usually in high demand. If you're assigned to a single team, you may not be top of mind for solving a problem elsewhere in the org, or your manager may be unwilling to let you go.
-   **Overshadowing other engineers**. A narrow scope can mean that there's not enough work to keep you busy, and that you may overshadow less experienced people and take learning opportunities away from them. If you always have time to answer all of the questions and take on all of the tricky problems, nobody else gets experience in doing that.
-   **Overengineering**. An engineer who's not busy can be inclined to make work for themselves. When you see a vastly overengineered solution to a straightforward problem, that's often the work of a staff engineer who should have been assigned to a harder problem.

The four disciplines that are needed in any job in the world:

-   **Core technical skills.** Coding, litigation, producing content, cooking—whatever a typical practitioner of the role works on
-   **Product management.** Figuring out what needs to be done and why, and maintaining a narrative about that work
-   **Project management.** The practicalities of achieving the goal, removing chaos, tracking the tasks, noticing what's blocked, and making sure it gets unblocked
-   **People management.** Turning a group of people into a team, building their skills and careers, mentoring, and dealing with their problems

### Chapter 2. Three Maps

When you join a new company, most of the big picture is completely unknown to you. A big part of starting a new job is building context, learning how your new organization works, and uncovering everyone's goals. Think of it like the fog of war in a video game.

For example:

-   Your locator map can help you make sure the teams you work with really understand their purpose in the organization, who their customers are, and how their work affects other people.
-   Your topographical map can help highlight the friction and gaps between teams and open up the paths of communication.
-   Your treasure map can help you make sure everyone knows exactly what they're trying to achieve and why.

Four risks:
Let's look at four of those risks now.

-   **Prioritizing badly.** When everyone around you cares about the same set of things, it's easy to magnify the importance of those things. The problems that exist outside your group can start to appear simple or unimportant by comparison. That's why you see teams making those local maximum decisions I talked about in Chapter 1: the local maximum starts to feel really important. The more time you spend staring at your own group's problems, the more they seem special and unique and worthy of special, unique solutions. And sometimes they are! But it's unusual to find a problem that is genuinely brand new. If you check for prior art and preexisting solutions, you'll spend less time reinventing wheels.
-   **Losing empathy.** It's easy to overfocus and forget that the rest of the world exists, or start thinking of other technology areas as trivial compared to your rich, nuanced domain. It's like you start looking at the world through a fish-eye lens that makes the thing right in front of you huge and squeezes everything else into the periphery. You can lose empathy for the work other teams are doing: "That problem they're solving is easy. I could solve it in a weekend.” The words you use, the things you choose to explain versus those you leave implicit, and the motivations you ascribe to other people will all be influenced by your perspective. That's why it can be so difficult for engineers to communicate with nonengineers. Loss of empathy shows up in incidents, too, where teams can get absorbed in the interesting technical details of the problem and forget there are users waiting for the system to be back online.
-   **Tuning out the background noise.** If one failure mode is your team's concerns seeming more important than everyone else's, another is the exact opposite: you stop noticing problems at all! If you've been working around the same mucky configuration file or broken deploy process for months, you might get so used to it that you stop thinking of it as something you need to fix. Similarly, you might not notice that something that started out as just slightly annoying has slowly become worse. Maybe a problem is close to becoming a crisis, but you don't even notice it anymore, so you can't be objective about how quickly you need to react.1
-   **Forgetting what the work is for.** Being in your silo can mean that you lose your connection to what's going on elsewhere in the company. If your group originally took on some project to solve a larger goal, the project might still be ongoing even though the goal no longer matters or has already been solved in some other way. If you're working only on your own little part of a project, it's easy to stop thinking about what the project is for. You can slip into a world where everyone does their own little part and nobody feels like they're responsible for the end result. You can lose sight of the ethics of what you're doing, too, and find yourself working on something that you wouldn't really be OK with if you stepped back and thought about the whole picture.

When the new person on your team looks at an architectural tangle or a pile of technical debt, they have no historical context. As my colleague, Dan Na, says, a new person can always see the problems. They haven't been around for the gradual change and the boiling frogs: they're just seeing the raw situation as it is. Without preconceptions, they're free to look around and ask, "What's really happening here? Is any of this working?”

Go beyond engineering: build relationships with product folks, customer support, administrative staff, and more. If your work affects them or their work affects you, go be friendly and understand their point of view. It will give you a whole new way of thinking about what's important to your department or your business.

Charity Majors, CTO of Honeycomb, often hands out stickers that say: "Nines don't matter when users aren't happy.”

You need to measure success from your users' point of view. (If your customers are other teams inside your company, this still applies!) If you don't understand your customer, you don't have real perspective on what's important.

Let's explore some of the difficulties you'll face if you set out on a mission without a detailed map of the terrain:

-   **Your good ideas don't get traction.** Being right about a need for change is less than half the battle. You'll have to convince other people that you're right and, even more difficult, convince them to care that you're right. That means knowing how to build momentum within your organization: figuring out who can sponsor your idea or help it spread, and how you can get it over the finish line and make it "real.”
-   **You don't find out about the difficult parts until you get there.** Many obvious-seeming journeys have some crucial point that nobody has figured out how to get past. You may be attempting to scale a cliff that's defeated many other people before. Staff engineers can often navigate past obstacles that less experienced engineers can't, and it's possible that you'll be able to succeed where others have failed. But if you know where people got stymied in the past, you can take a different path or solve the hardest part of the problem first, so other people will be convinced the project is worth their effort.
-   **Everything takes longer.** Unless you know how your organization works, decisions that should be straightforward will take months or quarters. The mechanics of your organization's planning cycles will affect you too. There are times of year when it'll be easier to make the case for staffing a new project or to rally everyone behind some goal. If you announce an initiative immediately after the quarterly engineering OKRs have been set, you'll have a hard fight and you may have to wait a quarter before you'll see any progress toward your goal.

**Secret or open?**
How much does everyone know? In secret organizations, information is currency and nobody gives it away easily. Everyone's calendars are private. Slack channels are invite-only. Often you can get access to something if you ask for it, but you have to know it exists! When all information is need-to-know, it's harder to come up with creative solutions or really understand why something's not working.

One team I worked in had a cowboy hat that would end up on the desk of whichever team member had last done something a little too "Wild West.” It was affectionate, but it was a good reminder too.

**Top-down or bottom-up?**
Where do initiatives come from? A completely bottom-up culture is one where employees and teams feel empowered to make their own decisions and champion the initiatives they think are important. However, when those initiatives need broader support, they slow down. If teams disagree about direction or priority, the lack of a central "decider” can lead to deadlock.

On the other hand, people in a fully top-down company will find it much easier to choose initiatives and take decisive action. Those decisions won't be the best ones, though, because they're missing local context. The engineers likely feel controlled and won't be empowered to react to changes as they arise.

**Fortresses**
Fortresses are teams or individuals who seem determined to stop anyone from getting projects done. Maybe you need their approval but can't get time with them. Or maybe they're gatekeepers and seem to decide your idea is bad before they even know what you're asking. Although some fortresses are petty tyrants, the majority are well-intentioned. They gatekeep because they care. They're trying to keep the quality of the code or architecture high and keep everyone safe.

To pass through the fortress gates, you might need to bring a token of sponsorship from someone the gatekeeper respects, or know the password to lower the drawbridge. (Common passwords include proving that you've mitigated all of the risks of your proposed change, completing lengthy checklists or capacity estimates, or replying to huge numbers of document comments with acceptable answers.)

Unfortunately, not all roads are well paved. We've all tried to solve a problem the official way for a long time before someone told us the secret path to success: the undocumented search feature, the admin who can set up an account for you, or the one person in IT who responds to DMs.

Remember that cartography is inherently political: what you choose to include says something about you as well. Pay attention to what you put at the center of the map and where you’re inclined to take sides.

If you don’t understand how decisions are made in your organization or company, you’ll find yourself unable to anticipate or influence them.

If you’ve watched the musical Hamilton, you’ll remember Aaron Burr’s craving to be “in the room where it happens.” As Burr tells us, people who aren’t in the room “don’t get a say in what they trade away”.

Figure out where decisions are happening.

Adding someone to a group is rarely free for the people who are already there. Every extra person in any meeting slows it down, extends discussions, and reduces attendees’ willingness to be vulnerable or brutally honest. If the group is used to working together, every new person resets the dynamic; to some extent, attendees have to learn to work together again.

Will Larson’s article “Getting in the Room” emphasizes that as well as adding value to the room, you need to reduce the cost of including you: show up prepared, speak concisely, and be a collaborative, low-friction contributor. If you make the room less effective at making decisions or sharing information quickly, you won’t be invited back.

The “shadow org chart”: the unwritten structures through which power and influence flow. The shadow org chart helps you understand who the influencers of the group are, and it’s probably not the same as the actual org chart. These influencers are the people you need to convince before a change can happen.

The authors identify “connectors” who know people all across the org, and “old-timers” who, regardless of rank or title, wield influence just from being around a long time. These folks are likely to have a good pulse on what can and can’t work, and the people who do have rank and title will likely trust them and rely on their good judgment when making decisions.

I asked on Rands Leadership Slack about how everyone approaches knowing things, and a common thread was paying attention to information that isn’t secret exactly, but isn’t necessarily for you. This included reading senior people’s calendars, skimming agendas or notes for meetings you’re not in, and—something that had never occurred to me—looking at the full list of Slack channels sorted by most recently created so you can see what new projects are happening.

The problems that slow down tech organizations are most often human ones: teams that don’t know how to talk to each other, decisions that nobody feels empowered to make, and power struggles.

### Chapter 3. Creating the Big Picture

A technical vision describes the future as you’d like it to be once the objectives have been achieved and the biggest problems are solved. Describing how everything will be after the work is done makes it easier for everyone to imagine that world without getting hung up on the details of getting there.

A technical vision is sometimes called a “north star” or “shining city on the hill.” It doesn’t set out to make all of the decisions, but it should remove sources of conflict or ambiguity and empower everyone to choose their own path while being confident that they’ll end up at the right place.

A strategy is a plan of action. It’s how you intend to achieve your goals, navigating past the obstacles you’ll meet along the way. That means understanding where you want to go (this could be the vision we just discussed!) as well as the challenges in your path. When I use the word strategy in this chapter, I always mean a specific document, not just being a strategic sort of thinker.

Take a tactic from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), whose principles of decision making famously reject “kings, presidents, and voting” in favor of what they call “rough consensus,” positing that “lack of disagreement is more important than agreement.” In other words, take the sense of the group, but don’t insist that everyone must perfectly agree. Rather than asking, “Is everyone OK with choice A?” ask, “Can anyone not live with choice A?”

Not deciding is a decision (just usually not a good one). When you’re choosing between Option A and Option B, there’s an implicit third option, C: don’t decide. People often default to Option C, because it lets them stay on the fence and not upset anyone. This is the worst thing you can do. Decisions constrain possibilities and make it possible to make progress. Not deciding is in itself a decision to maintain the status quo, as well as the uncertainty that surrounds it.

If you’re stuck, timebox it. Instead of saying, “We’ll choose the best storage system on the planet,” try, “Let’s research storage systems for the next two weeks and choose by the end of that time.”

Making someone unhappy is, unfortunately, inevitable when you’re creating a strategy or vision. If everyone gets their wish, it’s unlikely that you made any real decisions.

## Part II. Execution

### Chapter 4. Finite Time

There’s infinite work. There’s exactly one of you. Everything you commit to has an opportunity cost. By choosing to do one thing, you’re implicitly choosing not to do another.

Executive coach Fabianna Tassini of Confidantist gave me the best advice for managing my workload: put nonmeetings in the calendar too.

There’s a barrier to entry: you must have this much energy to be able to start this task.

Understand what kinds of work are expensive for you, and what kinds will leave you with some smartbrain at the end of the day.

When I asked on Twitter what causes a loss of credibility, one of the big themes was absolutism: if you’re a fan of some technology and advocate for it in every single situation, people will stop believing you know what you’re talking about.

Credibility extends to your skills as a leader, too. If you’re polite (even to annoying people), communicate clearly, and stay calm in stressful situations, other people will trust you to be the adult in the room. If you are rude or highly dramatic, send emails that are unreadable walls of jargon, or make all-hands meetings wait while you ask a rambling question that only applies to you, it will have the opposite effect.7 You will build credibility as a professional every time you take on a chaotic situation and make it easier for everyone else to understand. You’ll lose credibility when you’re seen as contributing to the chaos, or when a project goes badly and you don’t do a good job of navigating the failure.

Whether we talk about it or not, everyone has a bank account of capital with each of the people they know. If someone has built up credit with you, you’re more likely to do them a favor or give them the benefit of the doubt. Social capital is a mix of trust, friendship, and that feeling of owing someone a favor, or of believing they’ll remember that they owe you one.

Social capital builds up over time, and you’ll need more of it with some people than others. In general, you’ll want to stay on good terms with the people in your reporting chain and build a track record of helping them achieve their goals. If there’s a business-critical problem and you refuse to help, or you take on an important project and don’t complete it, you’ll burn goodwill. And if you always ask for favors but never repay them, you’ll start to find it difficult to get people to help you.

As Alexandre Dumas said, nothing succeeds like success.

The skills resource behaves a little differently from the others, because it’s always slowly decreasing. That doesn’t mean you’re forgetting what you know (though you will lose fluency with technologies or techniques that you don’t use for a long time); it means that any technical skill set slowly becomes less relevant and eventually gets out of date. Our industry moves fast. If you take on projects that teach you nothing (or at least nothing that’s relevant to the projects or roles you want), you won’t keep up with the rate of decrease.

As you work through your career, you’ll increase your skills bar in three main ways.

-   The first is by deliberately setting out to learn something: you take a class, buy a book, or hack on a toy project. While this kind of structured learning can often happen at work, you may struggle to find time for it, and find it spilling into your free time.
-   The second way is by working closely with someone who is really skilled. Being the least skilled person on a team of superstars will teach you more than being the best person on an otherwise mediocre team. When you work with great people, it’s almost impossible to avoid becoming greater yourself.
-   The third way—and the most common, I think—is learning by doing. You get better at what you spend time on. If there’s a skill you want to hone, the easiest way to practice it will be to take on projects that need that skill.

Pairing with someone very skilled for an afternoon can sometimes teach you more than you’d pick up in a week of learning on your own.

If you’re expecting some huge life event, this is probably not the time to start a project that will need a ton of your energy and attention.

In general, work that matters to the people in your reporting chain is work that builds social capital.  I suspect we all know the kinds of people who only optimize for looking good to leadership, and those aren’t people we tend to respect. But do keep an eye on your current standing with the people who influence your calibration, compensation, access to good projects, and future promotions. Managing up includes understanding your boss’s priorities, giving them the information they need, and solving the problems that are in their way—in other words, helping them be successful. Their success gives them social capital that they can spend to help you.

Your project can build—or lose—social capital with your peers depending on how it aligns with their values. I’ve seen many disapproving backchannel conversations along the lines of “I’m really surprised to see x person work for x distasteful project or company.”

Notice when you’re in danger of wasting your social capital. And be deliberate when you spend it to help other people, such as asking your company to interview a friend who has a résumé they would normally pass up. This form of support, sometimes called sponsorship, costs you something: if the person ends up failing, being a jerk, or otherwise being a regrettable choice, it will reflect on your judgment.

Some people make you better at your job without setting out to teach you anything: they’re so competent that you build skills just by bathing in their aura. OK, the reality is that you learn by watching the skill being executed well, but I’ve definitely had colleagues who seemed to have a magical effect on their team.

ively delegate.” He says that there’s guaranteed to be work that shows up on your plate on which you can “get an A” every single time, and if you give it to someone else, they’re probably going to get a B. But, he argues, a B is a pretty great outcome for their first time doing this kind of work: “You’re demonstrating trust by giving them work that’s scary to them and that you know—and they know—is beyond their means. ‘I know you can do this. I’m going to help you with this.’ That’s amazing.” The other person gets to learn. And maybe you can coach them from a B to an A.

Being the responsible person during a major incident also tends to increase credibility and social capital—assuming you do it well. 

You won’t succeed unless you can defend your time. The number of demands on it will increase and the number of available hours will stay the same, so be deliberate about what you prioritize. And, when you choose a project, make sure you have enough of the resources you’ll need to do a good job.

You are responsible for managing your energy.
